In order to solve the this weeks assignment, I had a closer look at the factoring demo. And started by copying both "init" functions. Thereafter I started with the receiving function.
The instructions were very clear regarding which packets should and how they should be processed so creating that function was quite straight forward.

As I was slightly confused with the other wifi related functions, I decided to continue from the prespective of user input.

I did the basic struct and arrays in order to complete the reset and show functions. There after I started to implement locate-link.
